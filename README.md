# VR Ambilight
#Introduction

The VR Ambilight is a project that enhances the immersive experience of virtual reality (VR) by creating dynamic ambient lighting that synchronizes with the on-screen content. This guide will walk you through the process of building your own VR Ambilight system.
Features

    Dynamic ambient lighting synchronized with VR content.
    Adjustable color and brightness settings.
    Support for Valve Index.

#Materials

Before you begin, make sure you have the following materials:

    Arduino Nano.
    RGB LED strip (addressable, 5V, preferably WS2812B).
    Soldering equipment.
    Computer with Arduino IDE installed.

#Wiring Diagram

Follow this wiring diagram to connect the components correctly:

Ensure that the LED strip you are using operates at a voltage of 5V.

Typically, for larger LED strip setups, you would require a separate power supply unit (PSU). However, in this case, the number of LEDs is small enough to be powered directly from the Arduino board itself.

#Software Setup

To set up the software, follow these steps:

    Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

    Clone or download the project files from the GitHub repository: [Insert GitHub Repository Link].

    Connect the Arduino to your computer using the USB cable.

    Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to File -> Open to open the project.

    In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools -> Board and select the appropriate board type (e.g., Arduino Uno).

    Go to Tools -> Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.

    Click on the Upload button (right-pointing arrow) to compile and upload the code to your Arduino.

    Once uploaded, the Arduino will be ready to control the LED strip.

#Building the VR Ambilight

Follow these steps to assemble the VR Ambilight system:

    Cut the LED strip to the desired length, keeping in mind the dimensions of your VR setup. Be sure to cut it at the designated cutting points.

    Attach the power supply to the LED strip. Connect the power supply's positive wire to the +5V pin on the LED strip and the negative wire to the GND pin.

    Connect the data line of the LED strip to the Arduino. Use the jumper wires to connect the DIN (data input) pin of the LED strip to any digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 6).

    Connect a 330 Ohm resistor between the Arduino's digital pin connected to the DIN pin and the LED strip's +5V pin.

    Connect the GND pin of the Arduino to the GND pin of the LED strip.

    Double-check all the connections and make sure they are secure.

    Plug in the power supply, and the LED strip should light up.

    Position the LED strip around the perimeter of your VR setup, ensuring an even distribution of light.

    Test the VR Ambilight by running a VR application or video content.

    Adjust the color and brightness settings according to your preference using the Arduino code.

Congratulations! You have successfully built your own VR Ambilight system. Enjoy the enhanced immersion during your virtual reality experiences!
Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the build or setup process, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

    Double-check all the wiring connections to ensure they are correctly connected.
    Verify that the power supply provides enough current for the LED strip.
